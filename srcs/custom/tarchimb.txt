Who is tarchimb?

After left the secondary school very young , Theo Archimbaud started to learn
cooking for few years in the beautiful region of Clermont-Ferrand, the city of
the emblematic and huge Michelin business..!

A few dishes later, and some travel, and drinks, and fun, and sex, and drugs, 
and... lot of things later.. Theo found the answer of everything, 42!

This is how, after the mythic pool of 42, he was taken in the school. Spending a
lot of time to debug his code, because of some SEGMENTATION FAULT / BUS ERROR
/ ABORT and fews leaks (really not that much), he finally land to this beautiful 
project, Minishell.

We hope you will enjoy our project :)

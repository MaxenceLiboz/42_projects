Who is mliboz?

Maxence Liboz is a former swimmer. Indeed, he practiced this sport since he was
a little boy. Many years, and many kilometers after, he got the opportunity to
spend two years in America, working, studing and swimming.

After his carrer done, he heard about a school, a very special school. Over there,
they were talking about doing a Piscine to enter the school. Immediatly it caught
his attention. Indeed, after all his life spending in pools, beatches, oceans he
couldn't resist to this call.

This is how, after the mythic Piscine of 42, he was taken in the school. Spending a
lot of time debugging his code, because of some SEGMENTATION FAULT / BUS ERROR
/ ABORT, and few leaks (really not that much), he finally land to this beautiful 
project, Minishell.

We hope you will enjoy our project :)

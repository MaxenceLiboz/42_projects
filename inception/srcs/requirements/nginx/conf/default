## DONT KNOW HOW TO CONFIG YET
# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding

# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.

# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.
